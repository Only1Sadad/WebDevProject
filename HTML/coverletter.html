                <p>When you spend your days issuing materials to cleanroom production cells, each transaction carries a weight beyond what’s on the scale. I’ve learned that <em>traceability</em>, <em>accuracy</em>, and <em>process integrity</em> are not just boxes to check—they’re the backbone of trust in any mission-critical system. That’s what drew me to your <span class="span-cover">Systems Engineer</span> Intern role. I see a through line between my hands-on work in regulated environments and your mission to build reliable, innovative systems for security and exploration.</p>

                <p>While earning my Computer Science degree at <span class="span-cover">Western Governors University</span>, I found myself gravitating toward projects that sit at the crossroads of hardware and software. Combining this with real-world experience in environments where compliance isn’t optional, I’ve become comfortable translating requirements into action, documenting outcomes, and collaborating across teams to close feedback loops. I can imagine myself supporting your integration and test activities, not only because I’m familiar with regulated workflows, but because I believe in building systems where every step, test, and record matters.</p>

                <p>I’m not coming in with all the answers, but I am bringing a willingness to dig into requirements, a habit of asking the questions that keep projects honest, and a respect for process that comes from seeing what happens when you skip steps. My hope is to contribute pragmatic solutions, learn from your teams, and help maintain the high standards that make Northrop Grumman’s systems dependable.</p>

                <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of working with people who treat engineering as both a craft and a responsibility.</p>
